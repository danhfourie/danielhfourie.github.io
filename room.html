<h1>Loft and Bunk Build</h1>

<p>
January 2010, I decided to build a new loft bed and desk. The older loft was very rickety, small and short and the old desk was much too small. 
</p>
<p>
I designed the wooden loft part by part in Solidworks to fit my room exactly. I was then able to put the whole thing together in a few hours total. The desk involved taking apart two standard ones and fitting them together into a much more expansive L shape.
