<h1>Cast Concrete Table: EE bench</h1>

<p>
My hall recently did some cleaning and discovered new space, which was promptly designated as a site for a new EE bench. My friend Julian and I decided to cast a concrete table to house the electronics equipment and soldering irons. We made a mold from 2x4s and plywood and hand mixed 360 lbs of concrete. The slab is 30"x56"x3.5" and reinforced with rebar. The reddish color comes from a concrete dye. Laser-cut pieces create inlays in the side of the final part.

The finished bench did not turn out as perfect as we had expected. While it was just fine structurally, the flat top surface was pitted because we did not use enough water in the mix. Also, we forgot to include the concrete die in the first batch.

<p>
Nevertheless, after building some legs and adding a set of shelves, the bench functions excellently. A computer was also added in addition to a monitor mounted on a moveable arm.
