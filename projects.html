<br>
January 2011
<p>
Team 2, comprised of four excellent engineers living on my hall, created the robot that took 1st place in the 2011 MASLAB competition. As the mechanical engineer, I was in charge of designing and fabricating a reliable and robust machine within a couple days.

<br>
Fall 2010
<p>
I designed this mini mill for the final project in MAS.863. It is built out of waterjet-cut aluminum and can be controlled manually or with steppers and a CNC system. The machine is stiff enough to cut through aluminum and has low vibration. It employs flexures and compliant motor mounts to avoid overconstraint.

<br>
Fall 2010
<p>
This links to another website that I created to document all of the projects that I completed during my semester taking MAS.863: How to Make Almost Anything. The class, taught by Neil Gershenfeld of the Media Lab's Center for Bits and Atoms, covers topics from 3D printing to microcontroller programming. My projects include a composite paddle and cast alloy piece.

<br>
Fall 2010
<p>
My twenty person team conceived and prototyped a spice dispensing machine for use in a grocery store. The customer selects a spice blend at the touchscreen, and a recipe-sized serving is dispensed in seconds. In addition to ideation and brainstorming, I did detailed design on the frame and collaborated on the door and carousel components.
