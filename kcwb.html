<p>
Kinematic couplings are used for locating objects repeatedly with respect to one another. This is
achieved by utilizing the concept of exact constraint in order to ensure that there is only a single
geometry where the objects can mate. 
</p>
<p>
This kinematic coupling mates a water bottle to the frame of my road bicycle.
Functional requirements included: easy to insert and retrieve bottle; road vibrations do not dislodge full
bottle; coupling must withstand thousands of miles of use on the bike; coupling must be fabricated
rapidly; coupling must be adjustable for different size bottles within reason; coupling must take up
minimal space; coupling should minimize fastener count and visibility.
</p>
<p>
The requirement that the bottle not dislodge under vibrations necessitates a large preload force.
This indicates a likely tradeoff with insertion force. As for the requirement for quick fabrication, I
decided early on that I would use the water jet machine to cut all the parts for the coupling.
The axial symmetry of the water bottle helps the design process immediately: only five degrees
of freedom need to be constrained.
</p>
<p>
The coupling was successfully cut in 30 minutes, machined in 90 minutes, and assembled in 10
minutes. The coupling has successfully endured over 200 miles (and counting) of riding without fail.
