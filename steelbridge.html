<h1>Steel Bridge Team member connections</h1>

<p>
As a member of MIT's Steel Bridge Team, I was responsible for designing several prototype member connections. This beam was composed of three steel tubes trussed together. As the bridge was required to be assembled quickly, each member had to lock together in one motion and then be fastened with a single bolt.
