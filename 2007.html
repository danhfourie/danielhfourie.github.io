<h1>2.007 Robot</h1>

<p>2.007 is a class at MIT called Design and Manufacturing I. Over the course of the semester, students individually build robots designed to score points by completing certain tasks on a "table". At the end of the year, the robots compete in a single-elimination bracket competition. This year, the Aztec themed challenge involved lifting "codices" to the top of a pyramid, putting steel balls through a hoop, and pulling over a lever. The lever multiplied your score depending on how far your robot pulled it over, so I focused on that in addition to lifting a codex. More information can be found at the <a href="http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/2/sp10/2.007/">2.007 website</a>.</p>

<p>My larger robot, Cortes (after the conquistador of the Aztecs), consists of an articulated arm mounted to a stationary base that grips a codex and fluidly lifts it to the top of the pyramid. I also built a smaller robot, Alvarado, to drive across the table, anchor to the wall, latch on to the lever, and winch it over. Here is a screenshot of the CAD model of the arm and base:</p>

<p>The two finished robots worked wonderfully at the contest and I placed 2nd!</p>

<p>The arm incorporates a turntable, a geared servo which deadlifts a parallel linkage forearm, and a cable actuated gripper. The turntable base was 3D printed and the aluminum side plates were made with a water jet machine. I modified two of the three servos for continuous rotation; the two potentiometers in the photo are for trimming.</p>

<p>The lever bot has only one actuator (the winch) besides the two drive motors for the wheels, so it has several passive mechanisms. The back of the robot has a grappling hook that is knocked off the robot and onto the table wall when the robot backs into the wall. The front has a one-way latch which locks onto the lever when the robot runs onto it. The harder the winch pulls, the more tightly the self-help latch grips onto the lever.</p>
