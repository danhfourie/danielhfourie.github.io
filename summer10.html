<h1>Smaller Projects Summer '10</h1>

<p>
Some of the other smaller projects that I worked on this summer:
</p>

<h3>Kinematic Coupling model</h3>
<img src="kc1.jpg" width="400"><img src="kc2.jpg" width="400">
<p>A kinematic coupling locates two surfaces with respect to one another with a very high degree of both accuracy and precision.
The coupling works by mating three balls on one surface with three grooves on the other surfaces.
The six resulting contact points exactly constrain the two surfaces. 
More about kinematic couplings at <a href="http://pergatory.mit.edu/perg/research/archive/Culpepper/kincouple.htm">PERG's site</a>.

<h3>Tensegrity Model</h3>

<p>
A model of the simplest tensegrity module built with fiberglass rods and string. 
I will be building a gigantic version built with 4x4s and winch straps for Rush.

<h3>Flexible Camera Tripod</h3>

A flexible tripod for my little camera. The compliant balls are made of Sugru.
The copper magnet wire legs are soldered and epoxied to a bolt.
