<p>
I had a need to measure the mass of some small quantities of organic matter to within a gram. I don't have a handy electronic cooking scale around the house, so I made this balance scale.

The spare imperial system straight edge serves as the stiff beam. It's also pre-incremented, so I just had to drill holes on the grooves. I drilled a few so that I could vary the lever arms. Copper wire for the hooks and little plastic containers for the baskets. I made a 1 gram mass by machining a bit of Al down to the appropriate volume.
