<h1>Unicycle Build</h1>


<p>I have finally finished my unicycle. It has taken me about 9 months mainly because I have used it as a test bed to try out different machining and welding ideas. It rides very smoothly, which is surprising because the bearings are nothing spectacular. I don't have a proper unicycling seat for it yet, but I cut down the sides of a bicycle seat so that I could sit more comfortably farther back.</p>

<p>
Currently I am using cranks with shaft holes that are slightly too large, so I have been forced to use various work-arounds to clamp to the axle. The next step will be to machine some custom cranks.
