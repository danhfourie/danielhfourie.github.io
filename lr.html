<h1>Semiautomatic Occlusion Device for Liver Resection</h1>


<p>
Liver resection involves the extraction of a cancerous tumor from the liver by removing a portion of the organ itself. The liver is a highly vascular organ and has the consistency of a bloody sponge. This makes it difficult for doctors to perform a resection without large blood loss. Furthermore, an accurate resection is easiest when the surgical field is bloodless.
