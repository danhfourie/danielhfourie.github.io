<h1>Drill Press Installation</h1>

<p>
My hall recently acquired a drill press and it needed a secure mount. We have an alcove that used to house a telephone booth which fit the bill perfectly. Because we didn't want to use fasteners to attach directly into the wall, yet the mount had to be rigid and sturdy, I drew up plans for a platform that 'compression-fit' between the concrete-backed walls. With some help from my hallmates, I routed power to the machine and assembled the structure in an evening.
