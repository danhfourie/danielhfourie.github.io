<h1>Precision Desktop Lathe</h1>


<p>
The lathe was designed with the end goal of surviving the death-test (destructive abuse) and winning the cutting competition. As the competition was a pure test of cutting speed, maximizing material removal rate is a must. Therefore, as each team was supplied the same power-plant, we deemed it utmost priority to minimize friction losses everywhere in our lathe. In particular, we opted for deep-groove ball bearings, a round belt transmission, and linear ball bearings. 
Here is a video of our highest performance test:

<p>(yeah, you saw 63A at 15V)</p>

Additionally, our unique lathe achieved higher precision through lower deflections by incorporating a third precision linear bearing shaft. This third shaft addresses the two largest sources of error in our lathe’s structural loop by providing an additional support for our headstock as well as a guide for a custom movable tailstock.

Double beam isolation and exact-constraint flexures further increased robustness.

Critically, extensive numerical modeling guided design decisions from the start and suggested many of our lathe's innovative features.
