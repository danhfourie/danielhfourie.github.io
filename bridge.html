<h1>Popsicle Stick Bridge</h1>

<p>
For a senior project in my high school Physics class, I designed and constructed a 60 cm span popsicle stick bridge which by far won the contest against about 10 other structures, bearing more load per weight than even the bridge designed by my teacher. It supports at least 200 lbs. loaded over a 6" length in the center.
