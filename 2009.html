<h1>dash: In-store Spice Dispensing Machine</h1>

<p>
My phenomenal team prototyped an in-store spice dispensing machine for our Product Engineering Process class, <a href="http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/index.html">2.009</a>. Over the course of the semester, we narrowed down hundreds of food-related ideas to a single viable product, developing sketch models all the way.

dash solves many problems. By dispensing recipe-sized quantities of spice blends, it eliminates the customer's need to buy large containers of expensive spice that quickly go bad on a shelf. dash serves as the starting point of a customer's trip to the grocery by suggesting new recipes with the appropriate ingredients. It saves money for the grocer and is a clean replacement for manual spice dispensing stations.

After the customer makes a spice blend selection at the touchscreen, the spice turntable quickly deposits the appropriate measured quantities into a container via a custom dispensing mechanism. The customer removes the container and takes a receipt.

Initial prototyped concepts included a 2-axis CNC collection system.
