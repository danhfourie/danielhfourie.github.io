<h1>International Design Competition, Shanghai, China</h1>

<p>
As an award for placing in the top three in the 2.007 contest, I was invited to travel to Shanghai for 2 weeks to compete in a similar international design contest. Working with a small team of students from China, Singapore, Korea, and Thailand, I created two successful remote-control robots. The poor quality of materials and available parts imposed unique design constraints. Working on a team that did not share a common language was an even greater challenge.
