<h1>Transverse Flux Electric Motor</h1>


<p>
Transverse flux motors are new. First conceived in 1988 by Weh, they are just now starting to be commercialized and the extensive possible variations on the architecture are still being explored. Most of the DC electric motors you see in everyday use are radial flux motors, which have several important physical limitations and tradeoffs such as pole count versus winding count (N). The transverse flux motor architecture solves many of these problems and can supply high torque and efficiency at low speeds, characteristics especially relevant to direct drive electric vehicles. I built a transverse flux motor this fall semester.

<p>
This fall and the past summer, I read up on the relevant literature and prior art in order to get a better sense of the different architectures already in existence. I then designed an architecture of my own that could be fabricated with 2D parts cut on a waterjet machine.  
In the image below, the thirty magnets (black blocks) and thirty flux concentrators (interleaved dark grey trapezoidal blocks) make up the thirty poles of the machine. Four aluminum rings hold the magnets in place and give structure to the rotor. The stator, made from custom silicon steel laminations courtesy of <a href="http://www.protolam.com/">Proto Laminations</a>, conducts flux from the copper coil loops up the 'sprocket' teeth to interact with the flux from the magnets.

<p>
Conservative calculations estimate the force produced at the motors airgap at around 100 N (torque ~5.4 Nm) and peak I^2R losses of 16W. The performance my be significantly better as analysis of the architecture with the E&M modeling software FEMM revealed that the flux at the airgap would be concentrated at greated than two tesla.

Characterization hopefully soon.
