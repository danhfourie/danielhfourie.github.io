<h1>MASLAB robot: Mechanical design</h1>

<p>
The <a href="http://maslab.csail.mit.edu/2011/">Mobile Autonomous Systems Laboratory</a> class during IAP challenges small teams to build a vision-driven robot in less than a month and to compete in a final competition involving collecting and scoring colored balls. The team from my hall, including Cathy Wu, <a href="http://snikolov.weebly.com/">Stanislav Nikolov</a>, Leighton Barnes, and myself, worked very hard together in order to achieve our goal of winning. 
</p>
<p>
The mechanical design features of the robot were instrumental in our eventual victory. The rapid and robust construction allowed full scale testing to begin immediately without fear of damaging the bot. The large intake roller and large-clearance hopper were forgiving with positioning errors in scoring. The compact, circular plan, rigidly mounted motors, and high-speed, no-slip wheels permitted rapid traversing of the playing field. More information on our design, along with videos, can be found in our <a href="http://maslab.mit.edu/2011/wiki/Team_Two/Final_Paper">Final Paper</a>.
